@par Application Description

How to demonstrate Point-to-Point communication using BLE component (as GATT server). 

Two STM32WB5MMxx boards are used, one acting as GATT client, and one as GATT server.
For example, BLE_P2PClient application is downloaded in a USB DONGLE board (MB1293C) and BLE_p2pServer application in a STM32WB5MM-DK board.
The client could be located in a phone also, using the ST BLE Sensor application instead of the MB1293C board.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32WB5MM-DK boards.

@par How to use it ? 

This application requires having the stm32wb5x_BLE_Stack_full_fw.bin binary flashed on the Wireless Coprocessor.
If it is not the case, you need to use STM32CubeProgrammer to load the appropriate binary.
All available binaries are located under /Projects/STM32_Copro_Wireless_Binaries directory.
Refer to UM2237 to learn how to use/install STM32CubeProgrammer.
Refer to /Projects/STM32_Copro_Wireless_Binaries/ReleaseNote.html for the detailed procedure to change the
Wireless Coprocessor binary.  
   
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and flash the board with the executable file
 - Run the example

Demonstration with smartphone as Client
On the android/ios device, enable the Bluetooth communications, and if not done before,
 - Install the ST BLE Profile application on the android device
	https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stm.bluetoothlevalidation&hl=en
    https://itunes.apple.com/fr/App/st-ble-profile/id1081331769?mt=8

 - Install the ST BLE Sensor application on the ios/android device
	https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.st.bluems
	https://itunes.apple.com/us/App/st-bluems/id993670214?mt=8

 - Power on the  STM32WB5MM-DK board with the BLE_P2P_Server application
 - Then, click on the App icon, ST BLE Sensor (android device)
 - connect to the device
 - select the P2PSRVx in the device list and play with the Light and the SW1 button of the board
