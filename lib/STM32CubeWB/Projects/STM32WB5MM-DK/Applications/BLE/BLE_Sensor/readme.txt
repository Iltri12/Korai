@par Hardware and Software environment

    - This application runs on STM32WB5MM Discovery Kit devices
  
    - STM32WB5MM Discovery Kit board Set-up    
       - Connect the Board to your PC with a USB cable type A to mini-B to ST-LINK connector (USB_STLINK).

@par How to use it ? 

This application requests having the stm32wb5x_BLE_Stack_fw.bin binary flashed on the Wireless Coprocessor.
If it is not the case, you need to use STM32CubeProgrammer to load the appropriate binary.
All available binaries are located under /Projects/STM32_Copro_Wireless_Binaries directory.
Refer to UM2237 to learn how to use/install STM32CubeProgrammer.
Refer to /Projects/STM32_Copro_Wireless_Binaries/ReleaseNote.html for the detailed procedure to change the
Wireless Coprocessor binary.  
   
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your IAR toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load the image into Target memory
 - Run the example

First demonstration
On the android/ios device, enable the Bluetooth communications, and if not done before,
 - Install the ST BLE Sensor application on the ios/android device
	https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.st.bluems
	https://itunes.apple.com/us/App/st-bluems/id993670214?mt=8

 - Power on the board with the BLE_Sensor application
 - At powered on, the screen displays the name of the board (STM32WB5MM), the stack version, the fuse version and the BD address during 5 seconds
 - Then, the board starts advertising (during 2 minute). During this phase, the distance measured by the Time-of-Flight sensor is displayed on the screen.
 - To connect the board to the smartphone, click on the App icon, ST BLE Sensor (android device)
 - connect to the device
 - select the STM32WBDK in the device list 
 - Then we have some demonstrations available :
		- environmental : Display humidity and temperature values
		- plot data : Plot data exported by the device (accelerometer, gyroscope, humidity, temperature)
		- LED Control : Switch on/off the LED by clicking on the led icon and receive alarm when SW1 is pushed
		- RSSI : Shows RSSI
		- Debug console : Serial console able to send commands to and receive messages from the board
