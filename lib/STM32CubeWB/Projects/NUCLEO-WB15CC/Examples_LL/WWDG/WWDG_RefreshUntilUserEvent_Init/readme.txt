@par Example Description

Configuration of the WWDG to periodically update the counter and 
generate an MCU WWDG reset when a user button is pressed. The peripheral initialization 
uses the LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

Example Configuration:
Configure the WWDG (Window, Prescaler & Counter) and enable it.
Refresh the WWDG downcounter in the main loop - LED2 is blinking fastly & continuously

Example Execution:
When User push-button (SW1) is pressed, the Downcounter automatic refresh mechanism is disable and thus, reset will occur.
After a reset when re-entering in the main, RCC WWDG Reset Flag will be checked and if we are back from a WWDG reset the LED2 will be switch ON.

Waiting a new User push-button (SW1) pressed to re-activate the WWDG
