@par Example Description

How to enter the Stop 1 mode.

After start-up LED2 is toggling during 5 seconds, then the system automatically 
enter in Stop 1 mode (Final state).

LED2 is used to monitor the system state as follows:
 - LED2 toggling : system in Run mode
 - LED2 off : system in Stop 1 mode

This example does not implement a wake-up source from any peripheral: to wake-up the device,
press on Reset button.



@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact 
      that the Cortex-M4 core is no longer clocked during low power mode 
      so debugging features are disabled.

@note On STM32WB, both CPU1 and CPU2 must be in Stop mode to set the entire system in Stop mode.
      In this example, CPU2 is not started-up and CPU1 configures the CPU2 Stop mode.
      If this example would be ported to another application, user must manage CPU2 entering Stop mode.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32WB15CCUx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-WB15CC
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - NUCLEO-WB15CC Set-up
    - LED2 connected to PB.00 pin
