@par Example Description 
  
How to use the default SysTick configuration with a 1 ms timebase to toggle LEDs.

  A "HAL_Delay" function is implemented based on the SysTick end-of-count event.
  Three LEDs are toggled with a timing defined by the HAL_Delay function.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
