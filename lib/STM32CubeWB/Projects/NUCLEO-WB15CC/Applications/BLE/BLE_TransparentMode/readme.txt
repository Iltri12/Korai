@par Example Description

How to communicate with the STM32CubeMonitor-RF Tool using the transparent mode.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32WB15xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with an STMicroelectronics STM32WB15CC-Nucleo
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

This application requires having the stm32wb15_BLE_Stack_full_fw.bin binary flashed on the Wireless Coprocessor.
If it is not the case, you need to use STM32CubeProgrammer to load the appropriate binary.
All available binaries are located under /Projects/STM32_Copro_Wireless_Binaries directory.
Refer to UM2237 to learn how to use/install STM32CubeProgrammer.
Refer to /Projects/STM32_Copro_Wireless_Binaries/ReleaseNote.html for the detailed procedure to change the
Wireless Coprocessor binary.  

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into Target memory
 - OR use BLE_TransparentMode_reference.hex from Binary directory
 - to test the BLE Transparent Mode application, use the STM32CubeMonitor RF tool
 - make the connection between STM32CubeMonitor RF tool and BLE_TransparentMode application
 - send some ACI commands from STM32CubeMonitor RF tool as HCI_RESET, HCI_LE_RECEIVER_TEST, HCI_LE_TRANSMITTER_TEST, ...
 - the application must acknowledge the command with a "Command Complete" answer
