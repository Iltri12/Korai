@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral in PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) 
mode.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32WB55RGVx Devices :
The CPU at 64 MHz 

SystemCoreClock is set to 64 MHz for STM32WBxx Devices.

    In this example TIM2 input clock (TIM2CLK) is set to APB1 clock (PCLK1),
    since APB1 prescaler is equal to 1.
      TIM2CLK = PCLK1
      PCLK1 = HCLK
      => TIM2CLK = HCLK = SystemCoreClock

    To get TIM2 counter clock at 1 MHz, the prescaler is computed as follows:
       Prescaler = (TIM2CLK / TIM2 counter clock) - 1
       Prescaler = ((SystemCoreClock) /1 MHz) - 1

    To get TIM2 output clock at 24 KHz, the period (ARR)) is computed as follows:
       ARR = (TIM2 counter clock / TIM2 output clock) - 1
           = 40

    TIM2 Channel1 duty cycle = (TIM2_CCR1/ TIM2_ARR + 1)* 100 = 50%
    TIM2 Channel2 duty cycle = (TIM2_CCR2/ TIM2_ARR + 1)* 100 = 37.5%
    TIM2 Channel3 duty cycle = (TIM2_CCR3/ TIM2_ARR + 1)* 100 = 25%
    TIM2 Channel4 duty cycle = (TIM2_CCR4/ TIM2_ARR + 1)* 100 = 12.5%

LED3 is ON when there are an error.

The PWM waveforms can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

@note The duty cycles values mentioned above are theoretical (obtained when the system clock frequency is exactly 64 MHz).
      They might be slightly different depending on system clock frequency precision.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note This example needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32WB55xx devices.
  - In this example, the clock is set to 64 MHz.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics P-NUCLEO-WB55 
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.      

  - P-NUCLEO-WB55 Set-up
   Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
        - TIM2_CH1 : PA.00 (pin 34 in CN7 connector)
        - TIM2_CH2 : PA.01 (pin 32 in CN7 connector)
        - TIM2_CH3 : PA.02 (pin 35 in CN10 connector)
        - TIM2_CH4 : PA.03 (pin 37 in CN10 connector)
