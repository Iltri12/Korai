@par Example Description

How to configure the clock recovery service in polling mode through the
STM32WBxx CRS LL API. The peripheral initialization uses LL unitary
service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

At the beginning of the main program the SystemClock_Config() function is used to 
configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 64 MHz.

Then, HSI48 and LSE oscillators are enabled.
In this example CRS will use LSE 
oscillator to calibrate HSI48 frequency.
When HSI48 and LSE are started, automatic calibration starts and program call the
polling function to wait for synchronization status.

In this test, there are results which could occur:
 - Wait for User push-button (SW1) press to start the test (Fast toggle LED2)
 - few loops occurs up to SYNC OK event (if SYNC WARN, HSI48 trimming value will be
 automatically modified)
 - in case of SYNC MISS or SYNC ERROR, there is an issue with synchronization input
 parameters. In this case, user need to apply new parameters after checking synchronization
 information and restart the synchronization.
 - LED2 LED2 toggles every 1 sec means that a timeout occurred during polling procedure. It may
 due to an issue with LSE synchronization frequency.
 - LED2 will finally power on if SYNC OK is returned by CRS.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32WB55xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with P-NUCLEO-WB55 board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - P-NUCLEO-WB55 Set-up
    - Connect the MCO pin to an oscilloscope to monitor HSI48 frequency:
      - PA.08: connected to pin 25 of CN10 connector (Arduino connector CN9 pin D6) for Nucleo-68  (MB1355)


@par How to use it ?
