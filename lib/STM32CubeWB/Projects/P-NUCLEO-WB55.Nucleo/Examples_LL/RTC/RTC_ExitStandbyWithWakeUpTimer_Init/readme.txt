@par Example Description

Configuration of the RTC to wake up from Standby mode 
using the RTC Wakeup timer. The peripheral initialization uses LL unitary service 
functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).
  
In this example, after start-up, SYSCLK is configured to the max frequency using
the PLL with MSI as clock source.

   @note LSE oscillator clock is used as RTC clock source by default.
      The user can use also LSI as RTC clock source. The user uncomment the adequate 
      line on the main.c file.
      @code
        #define RTC_CLOCK_SOURCE_LSE  
        /* #define RTC_CLOCK_SOURCE_LSI */
      @endcode
      LSI oscillator clock is delivered by a 32 kHz RC.
      LSE (when available on board) is delivered by a 32.768 kHz crystal.

   @note RTC wake up timer is one-second resolution based due to 1Hz internal frequency configuration.

Example execution:
   - 1st execution of the system, LED2 is quickly blinking (every 200ms).
   - RTC wakup timer is configured to 5 seconds
   - Press the User push-button (SW1):
     * System enters in standby mode (LED2 is switched off)
   - After 5 seconds, system resumes from standby mode, then LED2 is slowly blinking (every 500ms).

   - LED2 is toggling every 1 second: This indicates that the system generates an error.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32WB55xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with P-NUCLEO-WB55 board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
