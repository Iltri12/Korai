@par Example Description

Use of a timer peripheral to generate a 
PWM output signal and update the PWM duty cycle. This example is based on the 
STM32WBxx TIM LL API. The peripheral initialization uses 
LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

In this example TIM2 input clock TIM2CLK is set to APB1 clock (PCLK1),
since APB1 pre-scaler is equal to 1.
    TIM2CLK = PCLK1
    PCLK1 = HCLK
    => TIM2CLK = HCLK = SystemCoreClock (64 MHz)

To set the TIM2 counter clock frequency to 10 KHz, the pre-scaler (PSC) is
calculated as follows:
PSC = (TIM2CLK / TIM2 counter clock) - 1
PSC = (SystemCoreClock /10 KHz) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 64 MHz for STM32WBxx Devices.

Auto-reload (ARR) is calculated to get a time base period of 10 ms,
meaning a time base frequency of 100 Hz.
ARR = (TIM2 counter clock / time base frequency) - 1
ARR = (TIM2 counter clock / 100) - 1

Initially, the capture/compare register (CCR1) of the output channel is set to
half the auto-reload value meaning a initial duty cycle of 50%.
Generally speaking this duty cycle is calculated as follows:
Duty cycle = (CCR1 / ARR) * 100

The timer output channel must be connected to LED2 on board P-NUCLEO-WB55.
Thus LED2 status (on/off) mirrors the timer output level (active v.s. inactive).

User push-button (SW1) can be used to change the duty cycle from 0% up to 100% by
steps of 10%. Duty cycle is periodically measured. It can be observed through
the debugger by watching the variable uwMeasuredDutyCycle.

@note The LED2 is not toggling. In fact, if the dutycycle is 0% so the LED2 is OFF. When pushing 
successively the user button, the LED2 is ON and its luminosity rises as the dutycycle value keep 
increasing.
