@par Application Description

How to use MAC 802.15.4 Association and Data exchange.

This application requires two STM32WB55xx-Nucleo boards. One device will act as 
802.15.4 coordinator ensuring association response and network establishment. 
The other device will act as a MAC 802.15.4 RFD - Node. The Node request 
association on startup and send data to the coordinator. 

Below example implements the FFD Devices.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32WB55xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with an STMicroelectronics STM32WB55RG-Nucleo 
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    
  - On STM32WB55RG-Nucleo, the jumpers must be configured as described
    in this section. Starting from the top left position up to the bottom 
    right position, the jumpers on the Board must be set as follows:

     CN11:    GND         [OFF]
     JP4:     VDDRF       [ON]
     JP6:     VC0         [ON]
     JP2:     +3V3        [ON] 
     JP1:     USB_STL     [ON]   All others [OFF]
     CN12:    GND         [OFF]
     CN7:     <All>       [OFF]
     JP3:     VDD_MCU     [ON]
     JP5:     GND         [OFF]  All others [ON]
     CN10:    <All>       [OFF]


@par How to use it ? 

This application requests having the stm32wb5x_Mac_802_15_4_fw.bin binary flashed on the Wireless Coprocessor.
If it is not the case, you need to use STM32CubeProgrammer to load the appropriate binary.
All available binaries are located under /Projects/STM32_Copro_Wireless_Binaries directory.
Refer to UM2237 to learn how to use/install STM32CubeProgrammer.
Refer to /Projects/STM32_Copro_Wireless_Binaries/ReleaseNote.html for the detailed procedure to change the
Wireless Coprocessor binary. 


Minimum requirements for the demo:
- 1 STM32WB55xx-Nucleo board in MAC 802.15.4 FFD mode 
using current generated binary.
    (This device will be referred as COORDINATOR )
- 1 STM32WB55xx-Nucleo board in MAC 802.15.4 Node - RFD 
(see MAC 802.14.4 RFD example)
    (This device will be referred as NODE )

In order to make the program work, you must do the following: 
 - Connect 2 STM32WB55xx-Nucleo boards to your PC 
 
 COORDINATOR :
         - Open your preferred toolchain 
         - Rebuild all files and load your image into 
         COORDINATOR target memory 
         - The example run on Reset
 
 NODE :
         - Refers to  MAC 802.14.4 RFD example to build 
         and load generated image
     
To get the traces in real time, you can connect an HyperTerminal to the STLink Virtual Com Port.
 
 
 The Serial interface must be configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits 
    - Stop Bit = 1 bit
    - Parity = none
    - Flow control = none

  You can also use an MAC 802.15.4 other the air sniffer on channel 21 to spy 
 MAC 802.15.4 frames exchanged between the devices.
  
**** START DEMO ****

By default, after a reset, both board starts. Coordinator must be started firstly to be able to answer
to the node association request.

This MAC 802.15.4 example is to demonstrate Point-to-Point communication using MAC components between 
a FFD (ie.: the COORDINATOR) and an RFD (ie.: the NODE). 

Upon COORDINATOR start, the device initializes the MAC 802.15.4 and associates resources in non-beaconned
enable mode. 

MAC PIB is then configured as follow :
    PanID : 0x1AAA
    Coordinator Extended Address : 0xACDE480000000001
    Coordinator Short Address    : 0x1122

Once MAC PIB is initialized, FFD is started on channel 21 as an association capable coordinator.
At this stage the COORDINATOR is waiting for an association request. Blue LED (ID 1) is switch on once 
the coordinator is started.

On NODE side, the MAC layer is initialized on startup. In this state, blue LED (ID 1) is switch on.

RFD issues an association request to the COORDINATOR to retrieve its short address. 
On in coming association request FFD's green LED (ID 2) blinks.

Once the association between two devices is completed, RFD's green LED (ID 2) is switch on to indicate the node 
is associated to the coordinator. 

The NODE sends data to the coordinator that issues a Data Indication.
On both devices side, on data transmission red led (ID 3) blinked.

User can issue data from RFD to FFD, by pressing the button 1 (SW1). Data transmission can be then observe using OTA sniffer,
 UART logs and LED status. 


If you want to restart the demo, simply reset the NODE.
