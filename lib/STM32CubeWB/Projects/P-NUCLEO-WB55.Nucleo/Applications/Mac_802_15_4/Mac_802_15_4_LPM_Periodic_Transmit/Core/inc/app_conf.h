/**
 * Queue length of BLE Event
 * This parameter defines the number of asynchronous events that can be stored in the HCI layer before
 * being reported to the application. When a command is sent to the BLE core coprocessor, the HCI layer
 * is waiting for the event with the Num_HCI_Command_Packets set to 1. The receive queue shall be large
 * enough to store all asynchronous events received in between.
 * When CFG_TL_MOST_EVENT_PAYLOAD_SIZE is set to 27, this allow to store three 255 bytes long asynchronous events
 * between the HCI command and its event.
 * This parameter depends on the value given to CFG_TLBLE_MOST_EVENT_PAYLOAD_SIZE. When the queue size is to small,
 * the system may hang if the queue is full with asynchronous events and the HCI layer is still waiting
 * for a CC/CS event, In that case, the notification TL_BLE_HCI_ToNot() is called to indicate
 * to the application a HCI command did not receive its command event within 30s (Default HCI Timeout).

 * never be used)
 * It shall be at least 4 to receive the command status event in one frame.
 * The default value is set to 27 to allow receiving an event of MTU size in a single buffer. This value maybe reduced
