@par Example Description

How to read notifications from Apple Notification Center Service (ANCS) as specified by Apple specification 
and use the Heart Rate profile as specified by the BLE SIG with FreeRTOS.

The purpose of the Apple Notification Center Service (ANCS) is to give Bluetooth accessories (that connect to iOS devices 
through a Bluetooth Low Energy link) a simple and convenient way to access many kinds of notifications that are generated
on iOS devices. The publisher of the ANCS service (the iOS phone device) is referred to as Notification Provider (NP)
and the client of the ANCS service (ie. STM32 WB board) is referred to as a Notification Consumer (NC).This application 
use STM32 sequencer API to schedule SW tasks.
For more details about Apple Notification Center Service (ANCS) refer to Apple specification at:
https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/AppleNotificationCenterServiceSpecification/

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
      
@note This application is not supported by CubeMx but has been copied from the project BLE_HeartRate generated
      by CubeMx with some modifications to replace the call to the scheduler by the use of the cmsis_os interface

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32WB55xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with an STMicroelectronics STM32WB55VG-Nucleo
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

This application requires having the stm32wb5x_BLE_Stack_full_fw.bin binary flashed on the Wireless Coprocessor.
If it is not the case, you need to use STM32CubeProgrammer to load the appropriate binary.
All available binaries are located under /Projects/STM32_Copro_Wireless_Binaries directory.
Refer to UM2237 to learn how to use/install STM32CubeProgrammer.
Refer to /Projects/STM32_Copro_Wireless_Binaries/ReleaseNote.html for the detailed procedure to change the
Wireless Coprocessor binary.  

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and flash the board with the executable file

 On the android/ios device, enable the Bluetooth communications, and if not done before,
 - Install the ST BLE Profile application on the android device
	https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stm.bluetoothlevalidation&hl=en
    https://itunes.apple.com/fr/App/st-ble-profile/id1081331769?mt=8

 - Install the ST BLE Sensor application on the ios/android device
	https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.st.bluems
	https://itunes.apple.com/us/App/st-bluems/id993670214?mt=8

Considering connection with ios device:
 - Power on the Nucleo board with the BLE_HeartRateFreeRTOS_ANCS application
 - Then, click on the App icon, ST BLE Sensor (ios device)
 - connect to a device
 - select the HRanc in the device list
 - call your ios device by using another smartphone, the call will be answered automatically. or, send message to your ios device,the message can be displayed on terminal. 
   Warning: if the HRanc has already been bonded or pairing timeout, you should erase it from bluetooth connected ios device list and press SW3 stored bonded information.
            (in ios device settings: select bluetooth icon, then select my device and forget or ignore it).  
 The Heart Rate is displayed each second on the ios device.
 Moreover to display ANCS notifications messages, please open an hyper-terminal on PC 
 connected to Nucleo board by serial STlink Virtual com port with following settings:
    + baud rate: 115200
    + data: 8 bits
    + parity: none
    + stop: 1 bits
    + Flow control: none
    
 - The User buttons are configured as ( SW1 terminates BLE connection, SW2 review ANCS notification 
   and SW3 is used to remove bonded devices, reset  GAP security and terminate BLE connection).
